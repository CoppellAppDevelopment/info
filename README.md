# Coppell App Development Information

*ALL MEMBERS: Be prepared for a meeting in mid-November. Date to be announced in the coming weeks.*

The Coppell App Development (CAD) club of Coppell High School is oriented towards designing applications and programs across various platforms, including iOS and Android. Anyone who is interested in becoming a part of the 'Appifers' and attends CHS can join this club. We also hold workshops for those who would like to to learn how to create and design applications for either iOS or Android platforms.

Updates and other information from the club will be posted in our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/appify/). Join to be updated. If you would like to join CAD, please fill out this [new member interest form](http://tinyurl.com/cadsignupform).
